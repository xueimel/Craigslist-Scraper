craigslistScrape.py is a webscraper that can navigate to the craigslist
site in a given area and can print a list of all objects found.
After finishing collecting the information, the program prints
a list of all prices, titles, and hrefs.
The default location is Boise and would need to be altered to fit
user's location.
Can be easily be set up for daily auto-checks of craigslist via a simple
script.
